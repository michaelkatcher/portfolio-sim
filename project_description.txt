Goal:
- Building a portfolio simulator for a merchant cash advance funder in Python

Input Data:
- Our inputs are the historical list of funded deals and their performance to date. 

Features:
- Select a subset of deals based on a number of different criteria (deal product type, deal grade, deal size, deal vintage) 
- Given an allocation policy, generate a series of cashflows that would flow from this subset based on historical performance. Allocation policy ex: portfolio takes 25% of each deal with a minimum of $100,000 per deal and a maximum of $1,500,000 per deals, so: MAX(100000,MIN(1500000,0.25*DealSize))
- Calculate the performance of this portfolio of cashflows
- Add management fees to the portfolio and calculate the post fee performance (i.e. a servicing fee of 2% of every incoming cashflow on a deal after principal repayment). This will be generated as an additional line item in cashflows

Output:
- An Excel file with the following tabs:
 (1) 'Portfolio Scenario' - Lays out all of the selection criteria, fees, etc. for the portfolio
 (2) 'Cashflows' - A list of each individual cashflow in the portfolio
 (3) 'Deals' - A list of each individual deal in the portfolio
 (4) 'Analysis' - Calculation of IRR and MOIC for the portfolio as a whole and for each monthly vintage (a vintage is any deal that was funded in a given month)
