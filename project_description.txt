# MCA Portfolio Simulator Project Description

## Project Overview
The MCA Portfolio Simulator is a Python-based tool for simulating merchant cash advance (MCA) investment portfolios based on historical deal performance. The simulator allows users to apply various selection criteria, allocation policies, and fee structures to evaluate potential investment strategies using actual historical data.

## Current Functionality

### Core Components
- **Data Loading**: Loads historical deal and payment data from CSV files
- **Deal Selection**: Filters deals based on various criteria including deal size, vintage period, and product type
- **Portfolio Simulation**: Applies allocation policies to selected deals and simulates cashflows
- **Fee Application**: Calculates management fees based on configurable fee structures
- **Performance Metrics**: Calculates IRR, MOIC, and other performance metrics for the portfolio
- **Excel Export**: Generates formatted Excel workbooks with portfolio analysis results

### Command-line Interface
The simulator can be run from the command line with various parameters:
- Deal selection parameters (size, vintage, product types)
- Allocation policy parameters (percentage, minimum/maximum allocation)
- Fee structure parameters
- Output file configuration
- Logging options

### File Organization
- All file paths are now relative to the script directory, not the working directory
- Input data is stored in a 'raw_data' subdirectory
- Output files are saved to a configurable output directory
- Logs are saved to a 'logs' directory with customizable filenames

### Excel Integration
- An Excel workbook with VBA integration allows running the simulator directly from Excel
- Users can set parameters through form controls and worksheet cells
- A unique identifier is generated for each run to correlate output files with logs
- The Excel interface handles validation, execution, and result management

## Technical Details

### Data Pipeline
1. **Input**: Historical deal and payment data CSV files
2. **Processing**:
   - Deal selection based on criteria
   - Allocation calculation based on policy
   - Cashflow simulation based on historical performance
   - Fee calculation based on fee structure
3. **Output**: Excel workbook with multiple worksheets containing:
   - Portfolio scenario details
   - Complete list of cashflows
   - Deal allocations
   - Performance metrics (IRR, MOIC, etc.)

### File Path Management
The simulator now correctly handles file paths relative to the script directory:
- Input data files are loaded from the script's 'raw_data' subdirectory
- Output files are saved to a configurable directory (defaulting to 'output')
- Log files are saved to the script's 'logs' subdirectory

### Logging
- Configurable logging to both console and file
- Log files can be named with a custom identifier to correlate with output files
- Detailed logging of performance metrics and processing steps

### Performance Considerations
- The Excel export process is significantly slower when running through VBA/WSL compared to direct terminal execution
- Optimizations have been made to the Excel exporter to improve performance

## Recent Improvements
- Fixed file path handling to work consistently regardless of working directory
- Added support for custom log file naming
- Implemented proper allocation size limits (preventing allocations larger than deal size)
- Updated Excel formatting to remove decimal places in currency fields
- Fixed recalculation of initial cash outlays to include commissions
- Improved error handling and validation throughout the codebase
- Added VBA integration for Excel-based execution and management

## Current Limitations
- The Excel export process has performance limitations when run via VBA through WSL
- Some transaction types may not be properly handled in all scenarios
- The portfolio simulator uses a simplified model of MCA performance that may not capture all real-world complexities

## Future Development Directions
- Further performance optimizations for Excel export
- Additional portfolio simulation features and metrics
- Enhanced visualization options for portfolio analysis
- Multi-portfolio comparison tools
- Integration with financial planning tools
